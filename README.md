<h2>Some Of My Personal Projects 🛠️</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href = 'https://github.com/MatheusFinatto/movies-library'>Matheus Finatto's Movies Library</a> - a React app that utilizes the
        TMDB API to display information about movies, allowing users to search and
        browse for their favorite movies. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = 'https://github.com/MatheusFinatto/tde2-web'>Bootstrap Website Design</a> - a responsive website design using only
        HTML and CSS features. This project was made for college classes and
        demonstrates the use of a grid system, including a sidebar. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = 'https://github.com/MatheusFinatto/projeto-entregador-5'>IGDB based Games Library</a> - A Flask app that utilizes the IGDB API to display information about games. This is a Flask app that utilizes the IGDB API to display information about games. This project is one of my best non-professional works, but not everything was made by me, since I collaborated with three other students for this college project. I'm particularly proud of my contribution to the "best games" section of the website, witch I developed entirely by my own. While I didn't work on every aspect of the project, it's an excellent demonstration of my skills and abilities. <br />
 <b>If you had to choose just one project to see, I would highly recommend this one, since it's the most complete of them.</b>
